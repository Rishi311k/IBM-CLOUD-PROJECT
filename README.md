# IBM-CLOUD-PROJECT
This repository showcases the projects and courses completed during a 4-Week IBM internship on AI and Cloud Technologies.

The Problem Statement for The AGENTIC AI PROJECT is:
MACHINE FAULT DIAGNOSIS AGENT
This agent helps detect faults in machines like lathes, mills, or pumps based on vibrations, temperature, or unusual noises. It can answer: "Why is my CNC machine vibrating too much?" or "What could cause overheating in a hydraulic pump?". It suggests basic maintenance actions and safety precautions.
